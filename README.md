// Hello 
// this is a stock management console app 
// coding language : C
// it uses  3 text files to store data instead of database which gives it speed
// initially the files content is parsed into 3 different data structures (stack - linked list - queue)
// then it gives the user a menu to preform needed actions such as :
//    deleting products 
//    adding products
//    searching a certain product 
//    checking for orders(state - date , etc...)
//    and much more ...
// at the end these 3 different data structures (stack - linked list - queue) are stored again in the 3 text files 

// the choice of the programming langauage C , the text files , and the data structures was due to high speed requirement even for large stocks and orders data sets
